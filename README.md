# Time

This program allows you to decrement the system time instead of incrementing it, creating an effect of time going backwards. Such effect can be useful in certain scenarios.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following:

- A Unix-based operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS), or Microsoft Windows 10 or above.
- If you are using a Unix-based system, a bash shell, if you are using Windows, the ability to run PowerShell scripts.
- `sntp` command-line utility for Unix (usually pre-installed on most systems).

## How to Use

### macOS
#### Using this on macOS needs a little setup.
1. Download the DMG from the releases page, and open it by double clicking.
2. Move it to the applications folder as you would with any other macOS application.
3. Open the macOS terminal. You can do this by simply searching for it in Spotlight, or opening it from `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
4. Set the application's permissions to `executable`:
```
chmod +x /Applications/time-unix
```
5. After this, change the terminal's working directory to the Applications folder.
```
cd Applications
```
6. Launch the app with
```
sudo ./time-unix
```
Done!
You can always run the app from now on with opening the terminal, changing the working directory to `Applications` and launching the app with `sudo ./time-unix`.

### Windows
1. Download the Windows .exe from the releases page.
2. Right-click and choose "Run as administrator"!
Done

Note: Running with root/admin privileges is necessary to modify the system time. (If you leave the sudo out, or just double-click the exe, it will not work.)

## IMPORTANT

- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script BOTH on Windows and on macOS. NOT `âŒ˜ + c`.
This will reset your system time to the actual internet time. If you do not, or if you exit by clicking the close button, 
- Be cautious when running this script, as it modifies the system time. Make sure to reset the time after running the script to avoid any potential issues. If it would not reset automatically for some reason, you can always use:
```
sudo sntp -sS time.cloudflare.com
```
```c
Start-Service w32time
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"time.cloudflare.com" /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:YES
w32tm /resync /force
```

Enjoy!
